# Key Management App - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement & Solution Overview

### Problem Statement

Key managers (nyckelansvariga) in Swedish housing cooperatives (bostadsrättsföreningar) lack a systematic way to track physical keys, leading to security risks and administrative inefficiency. Current methods are inconsistent, incomplete, and don't transfer well between key managers, creating gaps in accountability and potential security vulnerabilities.

### Current Pain Points

- Inconsistent tracking methods with no standardized handover process
- Incomplete records making it difficult to get overview of key status
- No centralized location for key diagrams and access information
- Missing contact details for key holders
- Difficulty determining if keys are lent out or returned
- Security threats due to unknown key locations
- Administrative inefficiency (1-2 incidents per month in small cooperatives)

### Solution Overview

A web-based, mobile-first application that provides a centralized system for tracking physical keys, their locations, assigned areas, and current holders with contact information, while enabling smooth handovers between key managers.

## 2. Target User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Persona: The Key Manager (Nyckelansvarig)

- **Demographics**: Often pensioners/retirees with varying tech comfort levels
- **Role**: Elected/appointed volunteer in housing cooperative
- **Tenure**: Typically serves for multiple years
- **Technical Context**: Prefers mobile phone for day-to-day tasks, computer for initial setup
- **Responsibility**: Manages ~10 key types with varying copy quantities

### Key Management Context

- **Key Types**: Laundry, trash, basement, attic, electrical, elevator, master keys
- **Copy Quantities**:
  - High-volume keys (laundry/trash): 30+ copies (one per member)
  - Low-volume keys (technical/master): 2-3 copies
  - Modern systems: Generally fewer copies (2-3 per type)
- **Access Patterns**: Reactive checking when requests come in, potential for proactive monitoring

## 3. Core Features & User Stories

### Key Lending Workflow

**As a key manager, I want to:**

- Select specific key type and copy number
- Record borrower information: Name, Email, Phone, Company (optional), Notes (optional)
- Confirm ID has been checked (checkbox)
- Set optional end date with reminder capability
- Automatically timestamp the lending transaction
- Mark key as "out" in the system

### Key Return Workflow

**As a key manager, I want to:**

- Mark keys as returned
- Automatically clear lending record
- Make key available in inventory again
- Maintain borrower record in case they borrow other keys

### Key Inventory Dashboard

**As a key manager, I want to:**

- View stacked bar chart showing available/out/lost keys per key type
- Access sortable table of all key copies with current status
- Sort by key type or name of current holder

- **User Management**: Single admin user, expandable to max 2 users per account

### Data Structure

- **Persistent Data**: Key types, key copies, access areas, borrower records, lost key records
- **Temporary Data**: Active lending records (deleted on return)
- **No Historical Data**: No need to maintain lending history after return

### Security & Compliance

- EU data storage for GDPR compliance
- Secure authentication (2FA planned for future)
- Sensitive security information handling

### Notifications

- In-app reminders for overdue keys when logging in
- Dashboard alerts for pending actions
- Future: Scheduled email/SMS reminders

## 5. Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Success Metric
