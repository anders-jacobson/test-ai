### Completed Tasks

- [x] Create comprehensive PRD with user requirements
- [x] Define database schema with Prisma
- [x] Establish coding standards and cursor rules
- [x] Clarify authentication flow and data ownership

- [x] Test: Verify TypeScript compilation works (`npm run build`)
- [x] Add root navigation bar (`components/NavbarRoot.tsx`) to layout as NavbarRoot (for landing/auth pages only; dashboard will use a separate navigation component)

> **Note:** The project is now a standard single-app Next.js 15 repo with all configs and folders at the root. All future development should follow this structure.

### ✅ **Set up Supabase project with EU region**

### ✅ **Dashboard main content: chart and table**

- [x] Add stacked bar chart at the top of the dashboard main area (use shadcn/ui Bar Chart - Stacked + Legend)
- [x] Add pie chart showing total key status distribution

  - [x] **Update Prisma schema** to include auth_id field
  - [x] **Create migration** for auth_id column: `npx prisma db pull && npx prisma generate`
  - [x] Drop the existing incorrect policy: `DROP POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON "User"`
  - [x] Create optimized policy using auth_id comparison:
    ```sql
    CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON "User"
    FOR SELECT USING ( (select auth.uid()) = auth_id );
    ```
  - [x] Add INSERT/UPDATE policies for profile completion
