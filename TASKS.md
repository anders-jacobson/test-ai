# Key Management App Implementation Tasks

Implementation roadmap for the Swedish housing cooperative key management application.

## üîÑ Task Breakdown System

### **Status Indicators:**

- ‚úÖ **Broken down** - Task has detailed sub-tasks ready to work on
- ‚è≥ **Ready for breakdown** - High-level task ready to be detailed when needed
- üîÑ **In progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Finished and tested

### **Workflow:**

1. **Work on broken-down tasks** with detailed sub-tasks
2. **When ready for next task:** Use `@TASKS.md break down [task name]`
3. **I'll automatically** replace the high-level task with detailed sub-tasks
4. **Continue development** with clear, actionable steps

### **Example Request:**

```
@TASKS.md break down "Create basic layout and navigation structure"
```
